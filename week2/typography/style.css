/*Using the HTMLTemplate file provided to you, create an external CSS stylesheet to modify the typography of each of the body paragraphs.

Be sure to modify the following CSS properties for each paragraph of your page:

font-family

font-size

font-weight

line-height

Hint: You will need to do three things to accomplish this task.

Link to a CSS page that you'll make

Create classes for each paragraph

Add in styles for each class

Bonus:

If you finish early, read about TypePlate - http://typeplate.com/ and see if you can figure out how to incorporate it into your site.

If you still finish early, spend some time trying to actually make the page look nice. Think about what's aesthetically pleasing and push yourself to create it.*/
